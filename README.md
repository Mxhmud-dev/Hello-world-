# Hello World 👋
My first repository as I begin my journey toward AI and Machine Learning Engineering.

## About This Repository
This marks the beginning of my coding journey on GitHub. It's a simple starting point as I learn version control with Git and build my foundation in programming and data science.

                
- **Python fundamentals:** OOP, functions, loops
- **NumPy & Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and collaboration
- **Linear Algebra & Calculus:** Mathematical foundations for ML

                 
My roadmap follows a strategic progression:
1. **Data Analysis** (Current)
   - Building strong data manipulation and visualization skills
2. **Machine Learning**
   - Algorithms, model training, and evaluation
3. **AI Engineering**
   - Deep learning, model deployment, and production systems

                    
I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Starting with data analysis gives me the foundation to understand data deeply before building models on top of it.

## What's Next?
- Complete NumPy and Pandas mastery
- Build portfolio projects in data analysis
- Progress toward machine learning frameworks
- Contribute to open-source ML projects
